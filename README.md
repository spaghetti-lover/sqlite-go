# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your SQLite implementation is in `app/main.go`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `go (1.24)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.go`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Sample Databases

To make it easy to test queries locally, we've added a sample database in the
root of this repository: `sample.db`.

This contains two tables: `apples` & `oranges`. You can use this to test your
implementation for the first 6 stages.

You can explore this database by running queries against it like this:

```sh
$ sqlite3 sample.db "select id, name from apples"
1|Granny Smith
2|Fuji
3|Honeycrisp
4|Golden Delicious
```

There are two other databases that you can use:

1. `superheroes.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the table-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `superheroes`.
   - It is ~1MB in size.
1. `companies.db`:
   - This is a small version of the test database used in the index-scan stage.
   - It contains one table: `companies`, and one index: `idx_companies_country`
   - It is ~7MB in size.

These aren't included in the repository because they're large in size. You can
download them by running this script:

```sh
./download_sample_databases.sh
```

If the script doesn't work for some reason, you can download the databases
directly from
[codecrafters-io/sample-sqlite-databases](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/sample-sqlite-databases).
